    <h1 class="font-change">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
    <p id="green-text">To gain more knowledge. To apply the skills I will learn in Dev Academy and apply it in my career. I eventually would 
                like to become a Senior Software Engineer or a Engineering Lead.</p>
    <h1 class="font-change">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h1>
    <p id="green-text">I can learn things fairly quickly. But because of this I can sometimes not take all the information in because
        ive done it too quickly. I need to learn how to take time and not try and rush through the work.
    </p>
    <h1 class="font-change">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
    <p id="green-text"> Id like to get better at asking for help in a way that isn't annoying.

    <h1 class="font-change">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
    This should include: 
    An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
    Facilitators and industry/community representatives. 
    What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h1>
     <p id="green-text"> Allocate time and use toggl track to help monitor time.
        When things build up I need to stick to allocating time during the day to study.
        I work better in short bursts. 30 mins here 30 mins there. Sometimes I can focus and go for longer, say an hour.
        I find I work best 11 to midday and then I can focus till about 3pm - 4pm.

    <h1 class="font-change">
    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. A description of what you expect from 
    the Facilitation team any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
    For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
    <p id="green-text"> I will ask for help in the foundations help desk discord channel. 
        My expectation of the Facilitation team would be to help in any questions or issues I come
        up against.

        If im committed to other things. I will still need to prioritize my study. As its important for me
        learn and relearn the skills I need for my career.
