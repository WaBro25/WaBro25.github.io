<p><strong>When I was blocked on a simple problem</strong></p>

<p>In the JavaScript-Kata challenge I spent so much time on Manipulating objects specifically the second point </p>
<p>// 2. Give the adam object a name key that has the value "Adam".</p>
<p class="pre">adam  = {
        Name: “Adam”
}
</p>
<p>
Which wasn't correct. And it took a lot of research on doing dot notation for objects. So I found out using </p>
<p>
<p class="pre">adam.name = "Adam";</p>

<p>That creates a new property in the Adam object. Which passed the test! </p>

<p><strong>When I elegantly solved a problem</strong></p>

<p>Doing the javascript cafe last sprint.
    Doing the stretch exercises.
</p>
<p>I found a way that changes the text to red if it's out of stock.
    I struggled at first but after doing some research I found you can change
    The inner html text colour by using style.color = “Colour you want here”
</p>

 <p> I was able to use a condition that checked if the current stock was in stock
    And if it wasn't then change the text to red. Otherwise change it back to black.</p> 

<p class="pre">//if its out of stock change text to red
    if(!products.whiteCoffee.stock){
    document.getElementById("whiteCoffee").style.color = '#d00'
</p>
<p class="pre">
    //if its already red change it back to black text because we now have it
} else if (products.whiteCoffee.stock){
    document.getElementById("whiteCoffee").style.color = '#000000'
    }
</p>

<p><strong> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong></p>
<p>I found Pseudocode to be very helpful because you can write out roughly how you want to solve a problem. Your plan can 
    change but the core of the pseudocode is there. Its like freestyling a recipe. You have a rough guideline but you can add 
    and change things on the fly.
</p>
<p><strong>Trying something</strong></p>
<p>I would try a lot of different ways that come to my brain. Things like "Maybe I can use a map here to map out all the values in an array,
    maybe I can just use a for loop. Things like that. I like to try every possible solution.
</p>
<p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></p>
<p>I havent used the rubber duck method yet. But it seems like a great way to de bug issues.
</p>

<p><strong>Reading error messages</strong></p>
<p>Used this a lot especially in the kata challenges. Having the tests there helped seeing what was expected by a function.
</p>

<p><strong>Console.logging</strong></p>
<p>I use this a lot probably too much. But its a really great way to find out an output of something.
</p>

<p><strong>Googling<strong></p>
<p>Google is my best friend. I use this a lot. Stack overflow especially.
</p>

<p><strong>Asking your peers for help
    <strong></p>
    <p>I need to start doing this.
    </p>

<p><strong>Asking coaches for help<strong></p>
<p>I need to start doing this as well.</p>

<p><strong>Improving your process with reflection<strong></p>
    <p>I do this a lot. Sometimes if im stuck il take a break and have a coffee and reflect on what im doing.</p>

<p><strong> Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help.</strong></p>
<p>I find I havent got to this point yet. But I will keep it in mind when im really stuck.</p>
