    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <p><strong>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</strong></p>
    <p>Neuroplasticity is that the brain is malleable which means it can learn and 
        grow the more you exercise your brain muscle. 
        This can be beneficial for people to learn new things and not limit yourself.</p>

    <p><strong>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</strong></p>
    <p>Like any other muscle in the body. 
        The more you exercise your brain with 
        learning and repetition the muscle will then grow. 
        I can add this as a benefit for myself because im learning new things and also 
        learning things I already know. 
        Both of these benefit me because im exercising my brain through neuroplasticity.</p>

    <p><strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?<strong></p>
    <p>Leaning new things. And learning through repetition.</p>

    <p>I used Gemini. It helped explain things in simple terms.</p>

    <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
    <p>A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities and 
        intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work. 
        It's also having a positive attitude to learning new things. 
        This is relevant in learning new things.</p>
        
    <p><strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong></p>
        <p>I already knew what a growth mindset was. But I found it good to relearn what it is.</p>
    
    <p><strong>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong></p>
    <p>I will use a growth mindset in this learning journey because 
       I understand that having the right attitude towards learning is beneficial.</p>
