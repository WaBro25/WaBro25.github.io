<h1>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.<h1>
<p>If it were a house. HTML would the skeleton. The walls and roof. 
    CSS would be the paint and the wallpaper. Javascript would be the 
    brains of the house. 
    The electrical wiring. 
    The water pipes. The air con, the heater. Etc</p>
    
<h1> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
</h1> 
<br></br>

<h1>If and else statements</h1>
<br></br>
<p>
 If I want a coffee: 
“If" there is coffee in the pot, "then" pour a cup.
"Else," if there's no coffee, "then" brew a new pot.
</p>

<h1>Sequence.</h1> 
<p>Order matters in control flows.</p>
    <ol class="orderedList">
        <li>Grind the beans.</li>
        <li>Turn on the coffee maker.</li>
        <li>Wait for the coffee to brew.</li>
        <li>Pour a cup.</li>
      </ol>
<h1>While loops:</h1>
<p>
    While the coffee is brewing, check on it at certain times. When done pour coffee in to mug. Finish
</p>
<h1>For loops:</h1>
<p>
    While each person wants a coffee pour them a coffee then finish when everyone has a coffee.
</p>
<h1>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h1>
<p>
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. 
    Is a way to view and manipulate HTML and CSS. It is done in a tree like structure. 
    With Document and HTML meta data at its root. 
    Then branching to the CSS and branching to the HMTL</p>

<h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h1>
    <p>
        Arrays are like if you were a ticket checker on a bus. 
        You need to check every person along the bus and check their ticket in sequential order
        However, you can also check another person not in sequential order by checking 
        another seat number and checking the ticket. (Check an Index in an array)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example Code for Array:</strong></p>
    <p class="pre">const colours = ["red", "green", "blue"]; 
        <br></br>
    console.log(colours[1]); // Output: "green"</p>

    <p><strong>An object has a key value pair. Meaning it comes in pairs. A key is associated with a value</strong></p>

    <p class="pre">
        const person = { 
        name: "Alice", 
        age: 30, city: 
        "New York" }; 
        <br></br>
        console.log(person.age); // Output: 30
        </p>

        <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h1>
        <p>Functions have an input and an output. You give it a value and it spits out another value.
            We can use functions to perform certain tasks this makes them helpful in programming because 
            if we need to execute a certain action we can use a function to do it.</p>
