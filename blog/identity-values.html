<h1 class="font-change">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h1>
<p id="green-text">TBC</p>

<h1 class="font-change">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h1>
<p id="green-text">I grew up very Maori and my grandma was very Maori in her ways. She taught me how important manners are. My dad taught me always being honest is a great thing. 
    And my mum taught me empathy. This has been a melting pot of my identity today.</p>

<h1 class="font-change">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h1>
<p id="green-text">I've always had a growth-mindset. This has helped me a lot in my career. I think it will help me learn a lot at Dev Academy Aotearoa too.</p>

<h1 class="font-change">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h1>
   <p id="green-text">I worked with both an in-office team and an offshore team. We discovered that the offshore team lacked the necessary skills to complete certain aspects of the project.
    This created tension within the team as no one felt comfortable addressing the issue with management.
    To address this, I initiated a discussion with my in-office team. We collectively decided to hold a meeting to openly discuss the situation and reach a shared understanding.
    In retrospect, this meeting was beneficial. It facilitated open communication and ultimately led to the replacement of some offshore developers with those possessing the required skillsets..</p>
